# Smart Soil Monitoring and Irrigation System

## Project Overview
This project is a **smart soil monitoring system** that collects real-time data on **temperature, moisture, and soil nutrients (NPK)**. The data is processed by an **ATtiny85 microcontroller** and transmitted via **XBee S2C Pro (Zigbee protocol)** to a central **ESP32 hub with another Xbee module**, which controls irrigation based on sensor thresholds.

## Features
- ‚úÖ Real-time monitoring of soil parameters (temperature, moisture, NPK levels)
- ‚úÖ Wireless communication via **XBee S2C Pro (Zigbee protocol)**
- ‚úÖ **ATtiny85-based** low-power sensor node
- ‚úÖ Central **ESP32 hub** for data processing and decision-making
- ‚úÖ Automatic irrigation control based on soil conditions

## System Architecture
The system consists of multiple **sensor nodes** deployed in the field, each containing:
- **LM35DZ** ‚Äì Soil temperature sensor
- **YL-69** ‚Äì Soil moisture sensor
- **Soil NPK Sensor (RS485-JXBS-3001) with MAX485** ‚Äì Measures nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels
- **ATtiny85** ‚Äì Microcontroller to read sensor data
- **XBee S2C Pro (Zigbee)** ‚Äì Wireless communication module
- **Battery-powered operation** with **voltage regulation (AMS1117 3.3V)**

The **central hub** is an **ESP32** that receives data from multiple sensor nodes and **triggers irrigation** if a node falls below predefined soil moisture or nutrient thresholds.
